# Practical Common Lisp in Info Format

[Practical Common Lisp](http://gigamonkeys.com/book/) - a great, free Common Lisp resource - typeset for [GNU Texinfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/), Emacs' interactive documentation system.

For when you've read enough in your browser to know that you don't want to read it in your browser.

To view in info-reader mode, open `pcl.info` with `C-u C-h i` (just as you would visit a file with `C-x C-f`).

Build from the project root with `$ makeinfo --no-split pcl.texi -o pcl.info`
