@unnumbered Letter to the Reader

Dear Reader,

Practical Common Lisp ... isn't that an oxymoron? If you're like most programmers, you probably know something about Lisp—from a comp sci course in college or from learning enough Elisp to customize Emacs a bit. Or maybe you just know someone who won't shut up about Lisp, the greatest language ever. But you probably never figured you'd see practical and Lisp in the same book title.

Yet, you're reading this; you must want to know more. Maybe you believe learning Lisp will make you a better programmer in any language. Or maybe you just want to know what those Lisp fanatics are yammering about all the time. Or maybe you have learned some Lisp but haven't quite made the leap to using it to write interesting software.

If any of those is true, this book is for you. Using Common Lisp, an ANSI standardized, industrial-strength dialect of Lisp, I show you how to write software that goes well beyond silly academic exercises or trivial editor customizations. And I show you how Lisp—even with many of its features adopted by other languages—still has a few tricks up its sleeve.

But unlike many Lisp books, this one doesn't just touch on a few of Lisp's greatest features and then leave you on your own to actually use them. I cover all the language features you'll need to write real programs and devote well over a third of the book to developing nontrivial software—a statistical spam filter, a library for parsing binary files, and a server for streaming MP3s over a network complete with an online MP3 database and Web interface.

So turn the book over, open it up, and see for yourself how eminently practical using the greatest language ever invented can be.

Sincerely,

Peter Seibel

“I have been complimented many times and they always embarrass me; I always feel that they have not said enough.” —Mark Twain

“Peter Seibel offers a fresh view of Lisp and its possibilities for elegantly solving problems. In Practical Common Lisp, he gives enough basic information to let you quickly see the power of the functional language paradigm. He then dazzles you with examples that seem almost magical in their simplicity and power. This read is pure fun from start to finish.” —Gary Pollice, from Dr. Dobb's Portal, May 17, 2006 article on the 2006 Jolt Awards

“Peter Seibel's Practical Common Lisp is just what the title implies: an excellent introduction to Common Lisp for someone who wants to dive in and start using the language for real work. The book is very well written and is fun to read—at least for those of us whose idea of fun extends to learning new programming languages.

Rather than spending a lot of time on abstract discussion of Lisp's place in the universe of programming lnaguages, Seibel dives right in, guiding the reader through a series of programming examples of increasing complexity. This approach places the most emphasis on those parts of Common Lisp that skilled programmers use the most, without getting bogged down in the odd corners of Common Lisp that even the experts must look up in the manual. The result of Seibel's example-driven approach is to give the reader an excellent appreciation of the power of Common Lisp in building complex, evolving software systems with a minimum of effort.

There are already many good books on Common Lisp that offer a more abstract and comparative approach, but a good ‘Here's how you do it—and why’ book, aimed at the working programmer, is a valuable contribution, both to current Common Lisp users and those who should be.” —Scott E. Fahlman, Research Professor of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University

“This book shows the power of Lisp not only in the areas that it has traditionally been noted for—such as developing a complete unit test framework in only 26 lines of code—but also in new areas such as parsing binary MP3 files, building a web application for browsing a collection of songs, and streaming audio over the web. Many readers will be surprised that Lisp allows you to do all this with conciseness similar to scripting languages such as Python, efficiency similar to C++, and unparalleled flexibility in designing your own language extensions.” —Peter Norvig, Director of Search Quality, Google Inc; author of Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp

“I wish this book had already existed when I started learning Lisp. It's not that there aren't other good books about (Common) Lisp out there, but none of them has such a pragmatic, up-to-date approach. And let's not forget that Peter covers topics like pathnames or conditions and restarts which are completely ignored in the rest of the Lisp literature.

If you're new to Lisp and want to dive right in don't hesitate to buy this book. Once you've read it and worked with it you can continue with the ‘classics’ like Graham, Norvig, Keene, or Steele.” —Edi Weitz, maintainer of the Common Lisp Cookbook and author of CL-PPCRE regular expression library.

“Two prehensile toes up!” —Kenny Tilton, comp.lang.lisp demon, reporting on behalf of his development team.

“Experienced programmers learn best from examples and it is delightful to see that Lisp is finally being served with Seibel's example-rich tutorial text. Especially delightful is the fact that this book includes so many examples that fall within the realm of problems today's programmers might be called upon to tackle, such as Web development and streaming media.—Philip Greenspun, author of Software Engineering for Internet Applications, MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

“Practical Common Lisp is an excellent book that covers the breadth of the Common Lisp language and also demonstrates the unique features of Common Lisp with real-world applications that the reader can run and extend. This book not only shows what Common Lisp is but also why every programmer should be familiar with Lisp.” —John Foderaro, Senior Scientist, Franz Inc.

“The Maxima Project frequently gets queries from potential new contributors who would like to learn Common Lisp. I am pleased to finally have a book that I can recommend to them without reservation. Peter Seibel's clear, direct style allows the reader to quickly appreciate the power of Common Lisp. His many included examples, which focus on contemporary programming problems, demonstrate that Lisp is much more than an academic programming language. Practical Common Lisp is a welcome addition to the literature.” —James Amundson, Maxima Project Leader

“I like the interspersed Practical chapters on 'real' and useful programs. We need books of this kind telling the world that crunching strings and numbers into trees or graphs is easily done in Lisp.—Professor Christian Queinnec, Universite Paris 6 (Pierre et Marie Curie)

“One of the most important parts of learning a programming language is learning its proper programming style. This is hard to teach, but it can be painlessly absorbed from Practical Common Lisp. Just reading the practical examples made me a better programmer in any language.” —Peter Scott, Lisp programmer

“Finally, a Lisp book for the rest of us. If you want to learn how to write a factorial function, this is not your book. Seibel writes for the practical programmer, emphasizing the engineer/artist over the scientist, subtly and gracefully implying the power of the language while solving understandable real-world problems.

In most chapters, the reading of the chapter feels just like the experience of writing a program, starting with a little understanding, then having that understanding grow, like building the shoulders upon which you can then stand. When Seibel introduced macros as an aside while building a test framework, I was shocked at how such a simple example made me really 'get' them. Narrative context is extremely powerful and the technical books that use it are a cut above. Congrats!” —Keith Irwin, Lisp Programmer

“While learning Lisp, one is often refered to the CL HyperSpec if they do not know what a particular function does, however, I found that I often did not 'get it' just reading the HyperSpec. When I had a problem of this manner, I turned to Practical Common Lisp every single time—it is by far the most readable source on the subject that shows you how to program, not just tell you.” —Philip Haddad, Lisp Programmer

“With the IT world evolving at an ever increasing pace, professionals need the most powerful tools available. This is why Common Lisp—the most powerful, flexible, and stable programming language ever—is seeing such a rise in popularity. Practical Common Lisp is the long-awaited book that will help you harness the power of Common Lisp to tackle today's complex real world problems.” —Marc Battyani, author of CL-PDF, CL-TYPESETTING, and mod_lisp.

“Please don't assume Common Lisp is only useful for Databases, Unit Test Frameworks, Spam Filters, ID3 Parsers, Web Programming, Shoutcast Servers, HTML Generation Interpreters, and HTML Generation Compilers just because these are the only things happened to be implemented in the book Practical Common Lisp.—Tobias C. Rittweiler, Lisp Programmer

“When I met Peter, who just started writing this book, I asked to myself (not to him, of course) ‘why yet another book on Common Lisp, when there are many nice introductory books?’ One year later, I found a draft of the new book and recognized I was wrong. This book is not ‘yet another’ one. The author focuses on practical aspects rather than on technical details of the language. When I first studied Lisp by reading an introductory book, I felt I understood the language, but I also had an impression ‘so what?’, meaning I had no idea about how to use it. In contrast, this book leaps into a ‘PRACTICAL’ chapter after the first few chapters that explain the very basic notions of the language. Then the readers are expected to learn more about the language while they are following the PRACTICAL projects, which are combined together to form a product of a significant size. After reading this book, the readers will feel themselves expert programmers on Common Lisp since they have ‘finished’ a big project already. I think Lisp is the only language that allows this type of practical introduction. Peter makes use of this feature of the language in building up a fancy introduction on Common Lisp.” —Taiichi Yuasa, Professor, Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Kyoto University

@section 1. Introduction: Why Lisp?

If you think the greatest pleasure in programming comes from getting a lot done with code that simply and clearly expresses your intention, then programming in Common Lisp is likely to be about the most fun you can have with a computer. You'll get more done, faster, using it than you would using pretty much any other language.

That's a bold claim. Can I justify it? Not in a just a few pages in this chapter--you're going to have to learn some Lisp and see for yourself--thus the rest of this book. For now, let me start with some anecdotal evidence, the story of my own road to Lisp. Then, in the next section, I'll explain the payoff I think you'll get from learning Common Lisp.

I'm one of what must be a fairly small number of second-generation Lisp hackers. My father got his start in computers writing an operating system in assembly for the machine he used to gather data for his doctoral dissertation in physics. After running computer systems at various physics labs, by the 1980s he had left physics altogether and was working at a large pharmaceutical company. That company had a project under way to develop software to model production processes in its chemical plants--if you increase the size of this vessel, how does it affect annual production? The original team, writing in FORTRAN, had burned through half the money and almost all the time allotted to the project with nothing to show for their efforts. This being the 1980s and the middle of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Lisp was in the air. So my dad--at that point not a Lisper--went to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to talk to some of the folks working on what was to become Common Lisp about whether Lisp might be a good language for this project.

The CMU folks showed him some demos of stuff they were working on, and he was convinced. He in turn convinced his bosses to let his team take over the failing project and do it in Lisp. A year later, and using only what was left of the original budget, his team delivered a working application with features that the original team had given up any hope of delivering. My dad credits his team's success to their decision to use Lisp.

Now, that's just one anecdote. And maybe my dad is wrong about why they succeeded. Or maybe Lisp was better only in comparison to other languages of the day. These days we have lots of fancy new languages, many of which have incorporated features from Lisp. Am I really saying Lisp can offer you the same benefits today as it offered my dad in the 1980s? Read on.

Despite my father's best efforts, I didn't learn any Lisp in high school. After a college career that didn't involve much programming in any language, I was seduced by the Web and back into computers. I worked first in Perl, learning enough to be dangerous while building an online discussion forum for Mother Jones magazine's Web site and then moving to a Web shop, Organic Online, where I worked on big--for the time--Web sites such as the one Nike put up during the 1996 Olympics. Later I moved onto Java as an early developer at WebLogic, now part of BEA. After WebLogic, I joined another startup where I was the lead programmer on a team building a transactional messaging system in Java. Along the way, my general interest in programming languages led me to explore such mainstream languages as C, C++, and Python, as well as less well-known ones such as Smalltalk, Eiffel, and Beta.

So I knew two languages inside and out and was familiar with another half dozen. Eventually, however, I realized my interest in programming languages was really rooted in the idea planted by my father's tales of Lisp--that different languages really are different, and that, despite the formal Turing equivalence of all programming languages, you really can get more done more quickly in some languages than others and have more fun doing it. Yet, ironically, I had never spent that much time with Lisp itself. So, I started doing some Lisp hacking in my free time. And whenever I did, it was exhilarating how quickly I was able to go from idea to working code.

For example, one vacation, having a week or so to hack Lisp, I decided to try writing a version of a program--a system for breeding genetic algorithms to play the game of Go--that I had written early in my career as a Java programmer. Even handicapped by my then rudimentary knowledge of Common Lisp and having to look up even basic functions, it still felt more productive than it would have been to rewrite the same program in Java, even with several extra years of Java experience acquired since writing the first version.

A similar experiment led to the library I'll discuss in Chapter 24. Early in my time at WebLogic I had written a library, in Java, for taking apart Java class files. It worked, but the code was a bit of a mess and hard to modify or extend. I had tried several times, over the years, to rewrite that library, thinking that with my ever-improving Java chops I'd find some way to do it that didn't bog down in piles of duplicated code. I never found a way. But when I tried to do it in Common Lisp, it took me only two days, and I ended up not only with a Java class file parser but with a general-purpose library for taking apart any kind of binary file. You'll see how that library works in Chapter 24 and use it in Chapter 25 to write a parser for the ID3 tags embedded in MP3 files.

@section Why Lisp?

It's hard, in only a few pages of an introductory chapter, to explain why users of a language like it, and it's even harder to make the case for why you should invest your time in learning a certain language. Personal history only gets us so far. Perhaps I like Lisp because of some quirk in the way my brain is wired. It could even be genetic, since my dad has it too. So before you dive into learning Lisp, it's reasonable to want to know what the payoff is going to be.

For some languages, the payoff is relatively obvious. For instance, if you want to write low-level code on Unix, you should learn C. Or if you want to write certain kinds of cross-platform applications, you should learn Java. And any of a number companies still use a lot of C++, so if you want to get a job at one of them, you should learn C++.

For most languages, however, the payoff isn't so easily categorized; it has to do with subjective criteria such as how it feels to use the language. Perl advocates like to say that Perl "makes easy things easy and hard things possible" and revel in the fact that, as the Perl motto has it, "There's more than one way to do it." @footnote{Perl is also worth learning as "the duct tape of the Internet."} Python's fans, on the other hand, think Python is clean and simple and think Python code is easier to understand because, as their motto says, "There's only one way to do it."

So, why Common Lisp? There's no immediately obvious payoff for adopting Common Lisp the way there is for C, Java, and C++ (unless, of course, you happen to own a Lisp Machine). The benefits of using Lisp have much more to do with the experience of using it. I'll spend the rest of this book showing you the specific features of Common Lisp and how to use them so you can see for yourself what it's like. For now I'll try to give you a sense of Lisp's philosophy.

The nearest thing Common Lisp has to a motto is the koan-like description, "the programmable programming language." While cryptic, that description gets at the root of the biggest advantage Common Lisp still has over other languages. More than any other language, Common Lisp follows the philosophy that what's good for the language's designer is good for the language's users. Thus, when you're programming in Common Lisp, you almost never find yourself wishing the language supported some feature that would make your program easier to write, because, as you'll see throughout this book, you can just add the feature yourself.

Consequently, a Common Lisp program tends to provide a much clearer mapping between your ideas about how the program works and the code you actually write. Your ideas aren't obscured by boilerplate code and endlessly repeated idioms. This makes your code easier to maintain because you don't have to wade through reams of code every time you need to make a change. Even systemic changes to a program's behavior can often be achieved with relatively small changes to the actual code. This also means you'll develop code more quickly; there's less code to write, and you don't waste time thrashing around trying to find a clean way to express yourself within the limitations of the language.2

Common Lisp is also an excellent language for exploratory programming--if you don't know exactly how your program is going to work when you first sit down to write it, Common Lisp provides several features to help you develop your code incrementally and interactively.

For starters, the interactive read-eval-print loop, which I'll introduce in the next chapter, lets you continually interact with your program as you develop it. Write a new function. Test it. Change it. Try a different approach. You never have to stop for a lengthy compilation cycle.3

Other features that support a flowing, interactive programming style are Lisp's dynamic typing and the Common Lisp condition system. Because of the former, you spend less time convincing the compiler you should be allowed to run your code and more time actually running it and working on it,4 and the latter lets you develop even your error handling code interactively.

Another consequence of being "a programmable programming language" is that Common Lisp, in addition to incorporating small changes that make particular programs easier to write, can easily adopt big new ideas about how programming languages should work. For instance, the original implementation of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), Common Lisp's powerful object system, was as a library written in portable Common Lisp. This allowed Lisp programmers to gain actual experience with the facilities it provided before it was officially incorporated into the language.

Whatever new paradigm comes down the pike next, it's extremely likely that Common Lisp will be able to absorb it without requiring any changes to the core language. For example, a Lisper has recently written a library, AspectL, that adds support for aspect-oriented programming (AOP) to Common Lisp.5 If AOP turns out to be the next big thing, Common Lisp will be able to support it without any changes to the base language and without extra preprocessors and extra compilers.6

@section Where It Began

Common Lisp is the modern descendant of the Lisp language first conceived by John McCarthy in 1956. Lisp circa 1956 was designed for "symbolic data processing"7 and derived its name from one of the things it was quite good at: LISt Processing. We've come a long way since then: Common Lisp sports as fine an array of modern data types as you can ask for: a condition system that, as you'll see in Chapter 19, provides a whole level of flexibility missing from the exception systems of languages such as Java, Python, and C++; powerful facilities for doing object-oriented programming; and several language facilities that just don't exist in other programming languages. How is this possible? What on Earth would provoke the evolution of such a well-equipped language?

Well, McCarthy was (and still is) an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher, and many of the features he built into his initial version of the language made it an excellent language for AI programming. During the AI boom of the 1980s, Lisp remained a favorite tool for programmers writing software to solve hard problems such as automated theorem proving, planning and scheduling, and computer vision. These were problems that required a lot of hard-to-write software; to make a dent in them, AI programmers needed a powerful language, and they grew Lisp into the language they needed. And the Cold War helped--as the Pentagon poured money into the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a lot of it went to folks working on problems such as large-scale battlefield simulations, automated planning, and natural language interfaces. These folks also used Lisp and continued pushing it to do what they needed.

The same forces that drove Lisp's feature evolution also pushed the envelope along other dimensions--big AI problems eat up a lot of computing resources however you code them, and if you run Moore's law in reverse for 20 years, you can imagine how scarce computing resources were on circa-80s hardware. The Lisp guys had to find all kinds of ways to squeeze performance out of their implementations. Modern Common Lisp implementations are the heirs to those early efforts and often include quite sophisticated, native machine code-generating compilers. While today, thanks to Moore's law, it's possible to get usable performance from a purely interpreted language, that's no longer an issue for Common Lisp. As I'll show in Chapter 32, with proper (optional) declarations, a good Lisp compiler can generate machine code quite similar to what might be generated by a C compiler.

The 1980s were also the era of the Lisp Machines, with several companies, most famously Symbolics, producing computers that ran Lisp natively from the chips up. Thus, Lisp became a systems programming language, used for writing the operating system, editors, compilers, and pretty much everything else that ran on the Lisp Machines.

In fact, by the early 1980s, with various AI labs and the Lisp machine vendors all providing their own Lisp implementations, there was such a proliferation of Lisp systems and dialects that the folks at DARPA began to express concern about the Lisp community splintering. To address this concern, a grassroots group of Lisp hackers got together in 1981 and began the process of standardizing a new language called Common Lisp that combined the best features from the existing Lisp dialects. Their work was documented in the book Common Lisp the Language by Guy Steele (Digital Press, 1984)--CLtL to the Lisp-cognoscenti.

By 1986 the first Common Lisp implementations were available, and the writing was on the wall for the dialects it was intended to replace. In 1996, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) released a standard for Common Lisp that built on and extended the language specified in CLtL, adding some major new features such as the CLOS and the condition system. And even that wasn't the last word: like CLtL before it, the ANSI standard intentionally leaves room for implementers to experiment with the best way to do things: a full Lisp implementation provides a rich runtime environment with access to GUI widgets, multiple threads of control, TCP/IP sockets, and more. These days Common Lisp is evolving much like other open-source languages--the folks who use it write the libraries they need and often make them available to others. In the last few years, in particular, there has been a spurt of activity in open-source Lisp libraries.

So, on one hand, Lisp is one of computer science's "classical" languages, based on ideas that have stood the test of time.8 On the other, it's a thoroughly modern, general-purpose language whose design reflects a deeply pragmatic approach to solving real problems as efficiently and robustly as possible. The only downside of Lisp's "classical" heritage is that lots of folks are still walking around with ideas about Lisp based on some particular flavor of Lisp they were exposed to at some particular time in the nearly half century since McCarthy invented Lisp. If someone tells you Lisp is only interpreted, that it's slow, or that you have to use recursion for everything, ask them what dialect of Lisp they're talking about and whether people were wearing bell-bottoms when they learned it.9

@section Who This Book Is For

This book is for you if you're curious about Common Lisp, regardless of whether you're already convinced you want to use it or if you just want to know what all the fuss is about.

If you've learned some Lisp already but have had trouble making the leap from academic exercises to real programs, this book should get you on your way. On the other hand, you don't have to be already convinced that you want to use Lisp to get something out of this book.

If you're a hard-nosed pragmatist who wants to know what advantages Common Lisp has over languages such as Perl, Python, Java, C, or C#, this book should give you some ideas. Or maybe you don't even care about using Lisp--maybe you're already sure Lisp isn't really any better than other languages you know but are annoyed by some Lisper telling you that's because you just don't "get it." If so, this book will give you a straight-to-the-point introduction to Common Lisp. If, after reading this book, you still think Common Lisp is no better than your current favorite languages, you'll be in an excellent position to explain exactly why.

I cover not only the syntax and semantics of the language but also how you can use it to write software that does useful stuff. In the first part of the book, I'll cover the language itself, mixing in a few "practical" chapters, where I'll show you how to write real code. Then, after I've covered most of the language, including several parts that other books leave for you to figure out on your own, the remainder of the book consists of nine more practical chapters where I'll help you write several medium-sized programs that actually do things you might find useful: filter spam, parse binary files, catalog MP3s, stream MP3s over a network, and provide a Web interface for the MP3 catalog and server.

After you finish this book, you'll be familiar with all the most important features of the language and how they fit together, you'll have used Common Lisp to write several nontrivial programs, and you'll be well prepared to continue exploring the language on your own. While everyone's road to Lisp is different, I hope this book will help smooth the way for you. So, let's begin.

@section 2. Lather, Rinse, Repeat: A Tour of the REPL

In this chapter you'll set up your programming environment and write your first Common Lisp programs. We'll use the easy-to-install Lisp in a Box developed by Matthew Danish and Mikel Evins, which packages a Common Lisp implementation with Emacs, a powerful Lisp-aware text editor, and SLIME,1 a Common Lisp development environment built on top of Emacs.

This combo provides a state-of-the-art Common Lisp development environment that supports the incremental, interactive development style that characterizes Lisp programming. The SLIME environment has the added advantage of providing a fairly uniform user interface regardless of the operating system and Common Lisp implementation you choose. I'll use the Lisp in a Box environment in order to have a specific development environment to talk about; folks who want to explore other development environments such as the graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) provided by some of the commercial Lisp vendors or environments based on other editors shouldn't have too much trouble translating the basics.2

@section Choosing a Lisp Implementation

The first thing you have to do is to choose a Lisp implementation. This may seem like a strange thing to have to do for folks used to languages such as Perl, Python, Visual Basic (VB), C#, and Java. The difference between Common Lisp and these languages is that Common Lisp is defined by its standard--there is neither a single implementation controlled by a benevolent dictator, as with Perl and Python, nor a canonical implementation controlled by a single company, as with VB, C#, and Java. Anyone who wants to read the standard and implement the language is free to do so. Furthermore, changes to the standard have to be made in accordance with a process controlled by the standards body American National Standards Institute (ANSI). That process is designed to keep any one entity, such as a single vendor, from being able to arbitrarily change the standard.3 Thus, the Common Lisp standard is a contract between any Common Lisp vendor and Common Lisp programmers. The contract tells you that if you write a program that uses the features of the language the way they're described in the standard, you can count on your program behaving the same in any conforming implementation.

On the other hand, the standard may not cover everything you may want to do in your programs--some things were intentionally left unspecified in order to allow continuing experimentation by implementers in areas where there wasn't consensus about the best way for the language to support certain features. So every implementation offers some features above and beyond what's specified in the standard. Depending on what kind of programming you're going to be doing, it may make sense to just pick one implementation that has the extra features you need and use that. On the other hand, if we're delivering Lisp source to be used by others, such as libraries, you'll want--as far as possible--to write portable Common Lisp. For writing code that should be mostly portable but that needs facilities not defined by the standard, Common Lisp provides a flexible way to write code "conditionalized" on the features available in a particular implementation. You'll see an example of this kind of code in Chapter 15 when we develop a simple library that smoothes over some differences between how different Lisp implementations deal with filenames.

For the moment, however, the most important characteristic of an implementation is whether it runs on our favorite operating system. The folks at Franz, makers of Allegro Common Lisp, are making available a trial version of their product for use with this book that runs on Linux, Windows, and OS X. Folks looking for an open-source implementation have several options. SBCL4 is a high-quality open-source implementation that compiles to native code and runs on a wide variety of Unixes, including Linux and OS X. SBCL is derived from CMUCL,5 which is a Common Lisp developed at Carnegie Mellon University, and, like CMUCL, is largely in the public domain, except a few sections licensed under Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) style licenses. CMUCL itself is another fine choice, though SBCL tends to be easier to install and now supports 21-bit Unicode.6 For OS X users, OpenMCL is an excellent choice--it compiles to machine code, supports threads, and has quite good integration with OS X's Carbon and Cocoa toolkits. Other open-source and commercial implementations are available. See Chapter 32 for resources from which you can get more information.

All the Lisp code in this book should work in any conforming Common Lisp implementation unless otherwise noted, and SLIME will smooth out some of the differences between implementations by providing us with a common interface for interacting with Lisp. The output shown in this book is from Allegro running on GNU/Linux; in some cases, other Lisp's may generate slightly different error messages or debugger output.

@section Getting Up and Running with Lisp in a Box

Since the Lisp in a Box packaging is designed to get new Lispers up and running in a first-rate Lisp development environment with minimum hassle, all you need to do to get it running is to grab the appropriate package for your operating system and the preferred Lisp from the Lisp in a Box Web site listed in Chapter 32 and then follow the installation instructions.

Since Lisp in a Box uses Emacs as its editor, you'll need to know at least a bit about how to use it. Perhaps the best way to get started with Emacs is to work through its built-in tutorial. To start the tutorial, select the first item of the Help menu, Emacs tutorial. Or press the Ctrl key, type h, release the Ctrl key, and then press t. Most Emacs commands are accessible via such key combinations; because key combinations are so common, Emacs users have a notation for describing key combinations that avoids having to constantly write out combinations such as "Press the Ctrl key, type h, release the Ctrl key, and then press t." Keys to be pressed together--a so-called key chord--are written together and separated by a hyphen. Keys, or key chords, to be pressed in sequence are separated by spaces. In a key chord, C represents the Ctrl key and M represents the Meta key (also known as Alt). Thus, we could write the key combination we just described that starts the tutorial like so: C-h t.

The tutorial describes other useful commands and the key combinations that invoke them. Emacs also comes with extensive online documentation using its own built-in hypertext documentation browser, Info. To read the manual, type C-h i. The Info system comes with its own tutorial, accessible simply by pressing h while reading the manual. Finally, Emacs provides quite a few ways to get help, all bound to key combos starting with C-h. Typing C-h ? brings up a complete list. Two of the most useful, besides the tutorial, are C-h k, which lets us type any key combo and tells us what command it invokes, and C-h w, which lets us enter the name of a command and tells us what key combination invokes it.

The other crucial bit of Emacs terminology, for folks who refuse to work through the tutorial, is the notion of a buffer. While working in Emacs, each file you edit will be represented by a different buffer, only one of which is "current" at any given time. The current buffer receives all input--whatever you type and any commands you invoke. Buffers are also used to represent interactions with programs such as Common Lisp. Thus, one common action you'll take is to "switch buffers," which means to make a different buffer the current buffer so you can edit a particular file or interact with a particular program. The command switch-to-buffer, bound to the key combination C-x b, prompts for the name of a buffer in the area at the bottom of the Emacs frame. When entering a buffer name, hitting Tab will complete the name based on the characters typed so far or will show a list of possible completions. The prompt also suggests a default buffer, which you can accept just by hitting Return. You can also switch buffers by selecting a buffer from the Buffers menu.

In certain contexts, other key combinations may be available for switching to certain buffers. For instance, when editing Lisp source files, the key combo C-c C-z switches to the buffer where you interact with Lisp.

@section Free Your Mind: Interactive Programming

When you start Lisp in a Box, you should see a buffer containing a prompt that looks like this:

CL-USER>
This is the Lisp prompt. Like a Unix or DOS shell prompt, the Lisp prompt is a place where you can type expressions that will cause things to happen. However, instead of reading and interpreting a line of shell commands, Lisp reads Lisp expressions, evaluates them according to the rules of Lisp, and prints the result. Then it does it again with the next expression you type. That endless cycle of reading, evaluating, and printing is why it's called the read-eval-print loop, or REPL for short. It's also referred to as the top-level, the top-level listener, or the Lisp listener.

From within the environment provided by the REPL, you can define and redefine program elements such as variables, functions, classes, and methods; evaluate any Lisp expression; load files containing Lisp source code or compiled code; compile whole files or individual functions; enter the debugger; step through code; and inspect the state of individual Lisp objects.

All those facilities are built into the language, accessible via functions defined in the language standard. If you had to, you could build a pretty reasonable programming environment out of just the REPL and any text editor that knows how to properly indent Lisp code. But for the true Lisp programming experience, you need an environment, such as SLIME, that lets you interact with Lisp both via the REPL and while editing source files. For instance, you don't want to have to cut and paste a function definition from a source file to the REPL or have to load a whole file just because you changed one function; your Lisp environment should let us evaluate or compile both individual expressions and whole files directly from your editor.

@node	2-4,  2-5, 2-3, Chapter 2
@section Experimenting in the REPL

To try the REPL, you need a Lisp expression that can be read, evaluated, and printed. One of the simplest kinds of Lisp expressions is a number. At the Lisp prompt, you can type 10 followed by Return and should see something like this:

CL-USER> 10
10
The first 10 is the one you typed. The Lisp reader, the R in REPL, reads the text "10" and creates a Lisp object representing the number 10. This object is a self-evaluating object, which means that when given to the evaluator, the E in REPL, it evaluates to itself. This value is then given to the printer, which prints the 10 on the line by itself. While that may seem like a lot of work just to get back to where you started, things get a bit more interesting when you give Lisp something meatier to chew on. For instance, you can type (+ 2 3) at the Lisp prompt.

CL-USER> (+ 2 3)
5
Anything in parentheses is a list, in this case a list of three elements, the symbol +, and the numbers 2 and 3. Lisp, in general, evaluates lists by treating the first element as the name of a function and the rest of the elements as expressions to be evaluated to yield the arguments to the function. In this case, the symbol + names a function that performs addition. 2 and 3 evaluate to themselves and are then passed to the addition function, which returns 5. The value 5 is passed to the printer, which prints it. Lisp can evaluate a list expression in other ways, but we needn't get into them right away. First we have to write. . .

@section "Hello, World," Lisp Style

No programming book is complete without a "hello, world"7 program. As it turns out, it's trivially easy to get the REPL to print "hello, world."

CL-USER> "hello, world"
"hello, world"
This works because strings, like numbers, have a literal syntax that's understood by the Lisp reader and are self-evaluating objects: Lisp reads the double-quoted string and instantiates a string object in memory that, when evaluated, evaluates to itself and is then printed in the same literal syntax. The quotation marks aren't part of the string object in memory--they're just the syntax that tells the reader to read a string. The printer puts them back on when it prints the string because it tries to print objects in the same syntax the reader understands.

However, this may not really qualify as a "hello, world" program. It's more like the "hello, world" value.

You can take a step toward a real program by writing some code that as a side effect prints the string "hello, world" to standard output. Common Lisp provides a couple ways to emit output, but the most flexible is the FORMAT function. FORMAT takes a variable number of arguments, but the only two required arguments are the place to send the output and a string. You'll see in the next chapter how the string can contain embedded directives that allow you to interpolate subsequent arguments into the string, à la printf or Python's string-%. As long as the string doesn't contain an ~, it will be emitted as-is. If you pass t as its first argument, it sends its output to standard output. So a FORMAT expression that will print "hello, world" looks like this:8

CL-USER> (format t "hello, world")
hello, world
NIL
One thing to note about the result of the FORMAT expression is the NIL on the line after the "hello, world" output. That NIL is the result of evaluating the FORMAT expression, printed by the REPL. (NIL is Lisp's version of false and/or null. More on that in Chapter 4.) Unlike the other expressions we've seen so far, a FORMAT expression is more interesting for its side effect--printing to standard output in this case--than for its return value. But every expression in Lisp evaluates to some result.9

However, it's still arguable whether you've yet written a true "program." But you're getting there. And you're seeing the bottom-up style of programming supported by the REPL: you can experiment with different approaches and build a solution from parts you've already tested. Now that you have a simple expression that does what you want, you just need to package it in a function. Functions are one of the basic program building blocks in Lisp and can be defined with a DEFUN expression such as this:

CL-USER> (defun hello-world () (format t "hello, world"))
HELLO-WORLD
The hello-world after the DEFUN is the name of the function. In Chapter 4 we'll look at exactly what characters can be used in a name, but for now suffice it to say that lots of characters, such as -, that are illegal in names in other languages are legal in Common Lisp. It's standard Lisp style--not to mention more in line with normal English typography--to form compound names with hyphens, such as hello-world, rather than with underscores, as in hello_world, or with inner caps such as helloWorld. The ()s after the name delimit the parameter list, which is empty in this case because the function takes no arguments. The rest is the body of the function.

At one level, this expression, like all the others you've seen, is just another expression to be read, evaluated, and printed by the REPL. The return value in this case is the name of the function you just defined.10 But like the FORMAT expression, this expression is more interesting for the side effects it has than for its return value. Unlike the FORMAT expression, however, the side effects are invisible: when this expression is evaluated, a new function that takes no arguments and with the body (format t "hello, world") is created and given the name HELLO-WORLD.

Once you've defined the function, you can call it like this:

CL-USER> (hello-world)
hello, world
NIL
You can see that the output is just the same as when you evaluated the FORMAT expression directly, including the NIL value printed by the REPL. Functions in Common Lisp automatically return the value of the last expression evaluated.

@section Saving Your Work

You could argue that this is a complete "hello, world" program of sorts. However, it still has a problem. If you exit Lisp and restart, the function definition will be gone. Having written such a fine function, you'll want to save your work.

Easy enough. You just need to create a file in which to save the definition. In Emacs you can create a new file by typing C-x C-f and then, when Emacs prompts you, entering the name of the file you want to create. It doesn't matter particularly where you put the file. It's customary to name Common Lisp source files with a .lisp extension, though some folks use .cl instead.

Once you've created the file, you can type the definition you previously entered at the REPL. Some things to note are that after you type the opening parenthesis and the word DEFUN, at the bottom of the Emacs window, SLIME will tell you the arguments expected. The exact form will depend somewhat on what Common Lisp implementation you're using, but it'll probably look something like this:

(defun name varlist &rest body)
The message will disappear as you start to type each new element but will reappear each time you enter a space. When you're entering the definition in the file, you might choose to break the definition across two lines after the parameter list. If you hit Return and then Tab, SLIME will automatically indent the second line appropriately, like this:11

(defun hello-world ()
  (format t "hello, world"))
SLIME will also help match up the parentheses--as you type a closing parenthesis, it will flash the corresponding opening parenthesis. Or you can just type C-c C-q to invoke the command slime-close-parens-at-point, which will insert as many closing parentheses as necessary to match all the currently open parentheses.

Now you can get this definition into your Lisp environment in several ways. The easiest is to type C-c C-c with the cursor anywhere in or immediately after the DEFUN form, which runs the command slime-compile-defun, which in turn sends the definition to Lisp to be evaluated and compiled. To make sure this is working, you can make some change to hello-world, recompile it, and then go back to the REPL, using C-c C-z or C-x b, and call it again. For instance, you could make it a bit more grammatical.

(defun hello-world ()
  (format t "Hello, world!"))
Next, recompile with C-c C-c and then type C-c C-z to switch to the REPL to try the new version.

CL-USER> (hello-world)
Hello, world!
NIL
You'll also probably want to save the file you've been working on; in the hello.lisp buffer, type C-x C-s to invoke the Emacs command save-buffer.

Now to try reloading this function from the source file, you'll need to quit Lisp and restart. To quit you can use a SLIME shortcut: at the REPL, type a comma. At the bottom of the Emacs window, you will be prompted for a command. Type quit (or sayoonara), and then hit Enter. This will quit Lisp and close all the buffers created by SLIME such as the REPL buffer.12 Now restart SLIME by typing M-x slime.

Just for grins, you can try to invoke hello-world.

CL-USER> (hello-world)
At that point SLIME will pop up a new buffer that starts with something that looks like this:

attempt to call `HELLO-WORLD' which is an undefined function.
   [Condition of type UNDEFINED-FUNCTION]

Restarts:
  0: [TRY-AGAIN] Try calling HELLO-WORLD again.
  1: [RETURN-VALUE] Return a value instead of calling HELLO-WORLD.
  2: [USE-VALUE] Try calling a function other than HELLO-WORLD.
  3: [STORE-VALUE] Setf the symbol-function of HELLO-WORLD and call it again.
  4: [ABORT] Abort handling SLIME request.
  5: [ABORT] Abort entirely from this process.

Backtrace:
  0: (SWANK::DEBUG-IN-EMACS #<UNDEFINED-FUNCTION @ #x716b082a>)
  1: ((FLET SWANK:SWANK-DEBUGGER-HOOK SWANK::DEBUG-IT))
  2: (SWANK:SWANK-DEBUGGER-HOOK #<UNDEFINED-FUNCTION @ #x716b082a> #<Function SWANK-DEBUGGER-HOOK>)
  3: (ERROR #<UNDEFINED-FUNCTION @ #x716b082a>)
  4: (EVAL (HELLO-WORLD))
  5: (SWANK::EVAL-REGION "(hello-world)
" T)
Blammo! What happened? Well, you tried to invoke a function that doesn't exist. But despite the burst of output, Lisp is actually handling this situation gracefully. Unlike Java or Python, Common Lisp doesn't just bail--throwing an exception and unwinding the stack. And it definitely doesn't dump core just because you tried to invoke a missing function. Instead Lisp drops you into the debugger.

While you're in the debugger you still have full access to Lisp, so you can evaluate expressions to examine the state of our program and maybe even fix things. For now don't worry about that; just type q to exit the debugger and get back to the REPL. The debugger buffer will go away, and the REPL will show this:

CL-USER> (hello-world)
; Evaluation aborted
CL-USER>
There's obviously more that can be done from within the debugger than just abort--we'll see, for instance, in Chapter 19 how the debugger integrates with the error handling system. For now, however, the important thing to know is that you can always get out of it, and back to the REPL, by typing q.

Back at the REPL you can try again. Things blew up because Lisp didn't know the definition of hello-world. So you need to let Lisp know about the definition we saved in the file hello.lisp. You have several ways you could do this. You could switch back to the buffer containing the file (type C-x b and then enter hello.lisp when prompted) and recompile the definition as you did before with C-c C-c. Or you can load the whole file, which would be a more convenient approach if the file contained a bunch of definitions, using the LOAD function at the REPL like this:

CL-USER> (load "hello.lisp")
; Loading /home/peter/my-lisp-programs/hello.lisp
T
The T means everything loaded correctly.13 Loading a file with LOAD is essentially equivalent to typing each of the expressions in the file at the REPL in the order they appear in the file, so after the call to LOAD, hello-world should be defined:

CL-USER> (hello-world)
Hello, world!
NIL
Another way to load a file's worth of definitions is to compile the file first with COMPILE-FILE and then LOAD the resulting compiled file, called a FASL file, which is short for fast-load file. COMPILE-FILE returns the name of the FASL file, so we can compile and load from the REPL like this:

CL-USER> (load (compile-file "hello.lisp"))
;;; Compiling file hello.lisp
;;; Writing fasl file hello.fasl
;;; Fasl write complete
; Fast loading /home/peter/my-lisp-programs/hello.fasl
T
SLIME also provides support for loading and compiling files without using the REPL. When you're in a source code buffer, you can use C-c C-l to load the file with slime-load-file. Emacs will prompt for the name of a file to load with the name of the current file already filled in; you can just hit Enter. Or you can type C-c C-k to compile and load the file represented by the current buffer. In some Common Lisp implementations, compiling code this way will make it quite a bit faster; in others, it won't, typically because they always compile everything.

This should be enough to give you a flavor of how Lisp programming works. Of course I haven't covered all the tricks and techniques yet, but you've seen the essential elements--interacting with the REPL trying things out, loading and testing new code, tweaking and debugging. Serious Lisp hackers often keep a Lisp image running for days on end, adding, redefining, and testing bits of their program incrementally.

Also, even when the Lisp app is deployed, there's often still a way to get to a REPL. You'll see in Chapter 26 how you can use the REPL and SLIME to interact with the Lisp that's running a Web server at the same time as it's serving up Web pages. It's even possible to use SLIME to connect to a Lisp running on a different machine, allowing you--for instance--to debug a remote server just like a local one.

An even more impressive instance of remote debugging occurred on NASA's 1998 Deep Space 1 mission. A half year after the space craft launched, a bit of Lisp code was going to control the spacecraft for two days while conducting a sequence of experiments. Unfortunately, a subtle race condition in the code had escaped detection during ground testing and was already in space. When the bug manifested in the wild--100 million miles away from Earth--the team was able to diagnose and fix the running code, allowing the experiments to complete.14 One of the programmers described it as follows:

Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is 100 million miles away is an interesting experience. Having a read-eval-print loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable in finding and fixing the problem.
You're not quite ready to send any Lisp code into deep space, but in the next chapter you'll take a crack at writing a program a bit more interesting than "hello, world."
